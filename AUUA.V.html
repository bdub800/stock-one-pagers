<h1 id="aluula-composites-inc.">Aluula Composites Inc.</h1>
<h3 id="business-summary">Business summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>ALUULA develops, assembles, and sells high-performance composite
textiles using a patented fusion process that bonds high-tech fibers and
coatings without heavy glues, yielding lighter, stronger, more durable,
and UV-resistant materials versus conventional fabrics.</li>
<li>Primary sales channels: performance outdoor (windsport, packs/bags,
tents, bike accessories, outdoor safety) and commercial industrial
(e.g., large-scale structures).</li>
<li>Key product families: ALUULA Gold (windsport leading material),
Aeris and Aeris X (high strength-to-weight; weldable/thermoformable;
X-weave reinforcement), Durlyte (abrasion/toughness for inflatables),
Graflyte (waterproof, UV- and puncture-resistant for ultralight packs).
Materials are recycle-ready.</li>
<li>The most mature vertical is windsport, where ALUULA has displaced
Dacron in premium kites/wings and acts as a visible ingredient brand
with multiple partners.</li>
<li>Manufacturing is currently via proprietary batch “fusion pods” (two
pods), with proven capacity for 0.925m width; the company is advancing
1.5m width to improve customer yields and reduce seams, waste, and
labor.</li>
<li>Ocean Rodeo’s operational assets were designated for sale and
operations discontinued in 2024 to eliminate channel conflict and focus
on ingredient-brand strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="recent-developments">Recent developments:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Achieved first $2.1m revenue quarter in Q3 2025 (+64% YoY), with
performance outdoor up 61% and commercial industrial up 106% YoY; pack
&amp; bag vertical up 68% YoY; sailing up 22% YoY.</li>
<li>Open sales orders exceeded $3m at July 31, 2025 (+245% vs. FY2024
year-end), supporting near-term revenue visibility.</li>
<li>Gross margin at 41% in Q3 2025 (within 40–45% target) and 42% YTD;
operating expenses (ex-SBC) held within a 15% range for three
consecutive quarters.</li>
<li>Validated an alternative manufacturing method to enhance capacity
and enable initial limited-scale 1.5m width production targeted for Q4
2025.</li>
<li>Capital actions: 20:1 share consolidation effective March 12, 2025;
Rights Offering in Jan 2025 raised gross $2.51m; repricing/extension of
unit warrants followed by acceleration trigger on Aug 1, 2025—resulting
in ~99.6% exercise of that class and ~$0.99m proceeds; related party
loan partial repayment ($0.2m).</li>
<li>Secured NRC IRAP funding (up to $75k) for an AI-driven QA/QC
initiative; continued WD Canada interest-free loan amortization; repaid
RRRF loan.</li>
<li>Expanded commercial pipeline: attended CANSEC, added two defense
prospects; progressing wind-power tow-kite R&amp;D program with
recurring orders; doubled commercial-stage brand partners in
packs/bags.</li>
<li>Share-based compensation rose due to option modifications aligning
exercise prices with market to support retention.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-issues">Key issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sales cycle length and diversification: New verticals require
collaborative development and field testing, delaying revenue;
concentration in windsport is easing but remains a factor.</li>
<li>Working capital and receivables: Inventory build to meet higher
orders increased cash use; 26% of A/R are &gt;90 days (includes ~$200k
tied to a heating variance credit), necessitating tight credit
management.</li>
<li>Manufacturing scale-up and quality: Transition to 1.5m width and
efficiency gains are critical; prior production heating variance and
legacy warranty reserves underscore the need for robust QA/QC.</li>
<li>Tariff and trade uncertainty: Potential US/Canada/China tariff
changes (announced intentions in early 2025) create input cost and
pricing risk; timing/scope still uncertain.</li>
<li>Talent retention and equity comp: Retaining specialized staff is
essential; equity incentives increase non-cash SBC expense and can
impact reported earnings.</li>
<li>Liquidity and financing: Although recent equity/warrant proceeds
support operations, the company must balance growth investment with
margin discipline and cash management; related-party loan ($0.8m)
remains outstanding to Jan 1, 2026.</li>
<li>IP protection and competitive dynamics: Reliance on trade secrets
and patents requires ongoing protection as ALUULA scales across markets
and geographies.</li>

<ul>
<li>Shares outstanding: 25,291,260 at July 31, 2025. Subsequent
exercises (Aug–Sep 2025) added 989,280 shares from accelerated warrant
exercises. Post-acceleration basic shares ≈ 26,280,540.</li>
<li>Warrants/options:
<ul>
<li>Unit warrants (ex. price $0.81) largely exercised: 24,379,560
(≈99.6% of that class) into 1,218,978 shares. Residual ≈110,393 warrants
(≈5,520 shares equivalent) may have expired at accelerated deadline;

<li>Bonus warrants from Jan-2025 Rights Offering: 26,250,000 warrants

<li>Cash and debt:
<ul>
<li>Cash: $1,223k at July 31, 2025; plus $801k gross proceeds from
August warrant exercises (pro forma cash ≈ $2,024k, before any
subsequent uses).</li>
<li>Debt (interest-bearing): $800k related-party loan + $471k WD Canada

<p>Enterprise Value (EV):</p>
<ul>
<li>EV (using basic shares, July 31 cash): EV = $49.9m + $1.271m –
$1.223m ≈ $50.0m</li>
<li>EV (using basic shares, pro forma cash incl. Aug proceeds): EV ≈
$49.9m + $1.271m – $2.024m ≈ $49.2m</li>
<li>EV (using fully diluted shares, pro forma cash; treats all
options/warrants as exercised without treasury method): EV ≈ $56.7m +
$1.271m – $2.024m ≈ $55.9m</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes on EV methodology:</p>
<ul>
<li>A strict treasury method would include only in-the-money dilutive
securities and add expected exercise proceeds to cash; strike prices for
options are not disclosed, and the remaining large warrant tranche is
OTM at $1.90, so the “basic” EV is most representative.</li>
<li>Including leases in EV would add ~$0.17m.</li>
